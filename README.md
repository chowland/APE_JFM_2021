# APE_JFM_2021
A set of Jupyter notebooks to accompany the article 'Quantifying mixing and available potential energy in vertically periodic simulations of stratified flows'
This article has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, and a preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02515.

The data needed to run these notebooks yourself can be found at https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.58957.

### Contents
- `figure_x.ipynb` can be used to recreate the figures of the paper
- `APE_guide.ipynb` provides a step-by-step overview for quantifying APE and diapycnal mixing rates from triply-periodic buoyancy perturbation fields.
- `3D_APE.py` is a script implementing this method for full three-dimensional flow fields
